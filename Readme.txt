## 🧠 AI Concrete Compressive Strength Finder

This web application uses **Machine Learning (XGBoost)** to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on 8 mix design factors (e.g., cement, water, aggregates, age, etc.).  
It is designed for **civil engineers, researchers, and students** to experiment with concrete mix designs.

### 💡 Key Features:
- Manual and CSV input options
- Auto-calculated features (Water/Cement ratio, Binder, Fine/Coarse)
- Real-time strength prediction
- Confidence interval display
- PDF & Excel report downloads
- Feature importance graph
- Dark Mode UI
- Mobile friendly
- Developer Info Panel
